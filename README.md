# The Code for Paper "SRFFNetï¼šSelf-refine, Fusion, Feedback for Salient Object Detection".
by Shuang Wu, Guangjian Zhang
# Prerequisites
* Python 3.7
* Pytorch 1.7
* OpenCV 4.0
* Numpy 1.15
* TensorboardX
* Apex
# Clone repository
```
git clone git@github.com:user-wu/SRFFNet.git
cd SRFFNet/
```
# Download dataset 
Download the following datasets and unzip them into data folder
* PASCAL-S
* ECSSD
* HKU-IS
* DUT-OMRON
* DUTS
# Download model
* If you want to test the performance of SRFFNet, please download the[model](https://baidu.com) into out folder
* If you want to train your own model, please download the pretrained model](https://baidu.com) into res folder
# Training
```    
cd src/
python train.py
```
* ResNet-50 is used as the backbone of F3Net and DUTS-TR is used to train the model
* batch=32, lr=0.05, momen=0.9, decay=5e-4, epoch=32
* Warm-up and linear decay strategies are used to change the learning rate lr
* After training, the result models will be saved in out folder
# Testing
```
cd src
python3 test.py
```
* After testing, saliency maps of PASCAL-S, ECSSD, HKU-IS, DUT-OMRON, DUTS-TE will be saved in eval/F3Net/ folder.
* trained model: url
